# HCL Sliders
*HCL Sliders* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).

This plugin contains sliders for various hue/colorfulness/lightness models for use in the sRGB color space and its linear counterpart. 

### Available Models

**sRGB Color Space**

*HSV* (Hue, Saturation, Value)

*HSL* (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

*HCY* (Hue, Relative Chroma, Luma/Relative Luminance)

**Oklab Color Space**

*OKHCL* (Hue, Relative Chroma, Referenced Lightness)

*OKHSV* (Hue, Saturation, Value)

*OKHSL* (Hue, Interpolated Saturation, Referenced Lightness)

*OKLCH* (Lightness, Chroma, Hue)

### Accepted CSS Syntax

*Hexadecimal* notations: Must be 3 or 6 digits in the order of RGB, i.e. `#AABBCC` `#abc`

*Oklab* notations: RGB values will be clipped to the sRGB gamut, i.e. `oklab(50% 0 0)`

*Oklch* notations: Hue can be given in deg, grad, rad or turn and RGB will be clipped, i.e. `oklch(50% 0.1 270)` `oklch(50% 0.1 300grad)` 

Some extra non-standard formats are also supported when parsing:

- Heximal without the `#` prefix, i.e. `AABBCC`
- Oklab/Oklch without the `okxxx` and brackets, i.e. `50% 0 0` (Or not using percentage value, like `0.5`)
- Oklch accepts negative angles for Hue i.e `-90` (equivalent to `270deg`)
